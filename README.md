# My Final Project for my DATA 252: Models and Machine Learning class.

### I love dinosaurs, and so when we were asked to build a classification model, I knew I wanted to incorporate my passion into my work. Unfortunately, there was no database or complete CSV that contained all of the information I wanted and needed for my project. Because of this, I undertook a large project of building my own on top of my final project. I was that determined to make it work. 

## Within this Repository, You Will Find:
- 4 CSV's
    - 3 of which were used to create the encyclopedia:

        -   data.csv
        -   dino.csv
        -   Jurassic Park Extended Edition - Sheet1 (2).csv

    - and the actual encyclopedia!
        -   DinoEncyclopedia.csv

            Please Credit me if you use this dataset; it was a ton of work!
- You will also find my analysis!
